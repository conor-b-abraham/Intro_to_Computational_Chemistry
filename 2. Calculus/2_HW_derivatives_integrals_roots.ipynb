The solutions to these should be submitted in a PDF document (do not submit image files!) with the problem numbers clearly labelled. Please write clearly and make sure your work can be clearly read and followed. The Adobe Scan phone app is free for BU students, so please use that (or a similar app or an actual scanner) rather than just taking pictures and converting them into pdfs so that I can easily read your work and leave comments if necessary.* \n",

Dropbox will automatically add your name to the file names. Please make sure you are not logged into someone else's dropbox account when submitting the homework. \n",

For example, \"hw3-final.ipynb\" would be the updated jupyter notebook and/or \"hw3-final.pdf\" would be the updated derivation document."
